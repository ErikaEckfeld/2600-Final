# Biometric Authentication 2600-Final
 **By Erika Eckfeld (eeewv9, 14258705)**
 
This is tutorial in markdown that is hosted on GitHub about biometric authentication, specifically facial recognition, and the powers it has. When thinking about security and technology, one of the first things that comes to mind is securing our devices and personal information. In this tutorial, I will explain the simplistic algorithms that go into facial recognition and talk about all of the different platforms it serves in today's world.

### Breif History of Facial Recognition

A little glimpse into the past of facial recognition begins with a history that can be traced back to the **1960’s** and a man named Bledsoe who developed a grid system that distinguished between facial parts. In the **1970’s** as processing power increased, more subjective markers were added. In the early **1990’s**, a linear algebra approach was brought in to bring codes to certain facial pairings. While this security feature used to be something of futuristic talk, nearly millions with an iPhone now have access to facial recognition after the iPhoneX came out in **2017**. Apple claims that their TrueDepth camera on the new iPhoneX analyzes over **30,000** dots on the face to create an infringed picture of the face for further detection. They claim it learns what a face looks like from different angles and is much more effective than the previous fingerprint authorization.
