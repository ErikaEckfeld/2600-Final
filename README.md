# Biometric Authentication 2600-Final
 **By Erika Eckfeld (eeewv9, 14258705)**
 
This is tutorial in markdown that is hosted on GitHub about biometric authentication, specifically facial recognition, and the powers it has. When thinking about security and technology, one of the first things that comes to mind is securing our devices and personal information. In this tutorial, I will explain the simplistic algorithms that go into facial recognition and talk about all of the different platforms it serves in today's world.

## Breif Overview of Facial Recognition

A little glimpse into the past of facial recognition begins with a history that can be traced back to the **1960’s** and a man named Bledsoe who developed a grid system that distinguished between facial parts. In the **1970’s** as processing power increased, more subjective markers were added. In the early **1990’s**, a linear algebra approach was brought in to bring codes to certain facial pairings. While this security feature used to be something of futuristic talk, nearly millions with an iPhone now have access to facial recognition after the iPhoneX came out in **2017**. Apple claims that their TrueDepth camera on the new iPhoneX analyzes over **30,000** dots on the face to create an infringed picture of the face for further detection. They claim it learns what a face looks like from different angles and is much more effective than the previous fingerprint authorization.

## True Depth Camera

This technology is one of the newest and is widely used bu millions of iphone users. How it works: using "selfie mode" with the front facing camera, the phone emits over 30,000 dots on the user's face. Then, the dots are translated by an infrared camera for detection analysis where facial features are sorted through for correct identification. The phone has a light emiting sensor and a spaicl reasoning sensor to tell wether or not the face is well enough lit and close enough to activate the infared camera detections. So basically, the right conditions need to be met for the analysis of facial features to begin.

## Places where facial recognition is widely used:
* Airports
* Law enforcement
* The government
* Retailers
* Phone companies
* Etc.
