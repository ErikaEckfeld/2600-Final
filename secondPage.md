## Airports

Today, **14 different airports** are now using facial recognition to identify faces. The new **boarder biometric exit pilot system** is used by a number of airports as well to identify visa holders as they leave the airport. Facial recognition’s purpose in airports is crucial to their **security and safety**.


## Law enforcement

The FBI is a huge user of facial recognition to track down suspects and identify them. Plainly, you pretty much can never get away with anything because the U.S. government’s facial recognition powers. They use **Elastic Bunch Graph Matching** which is a type of facial recognition that assumes that faces have many **nonlinear features** including pose, expression, lighting, and more. While there have been many successes from facial recognition, one of the most significant was when it helped the U.S. government detect **Osama Bin Laden** for capture in 2011. Though the FBI has the highest end of facial recognition technology, rapid growth and pace is needed to keep up with those minds who try to dodge their methods of identification.


## Retailers

Alike the FBI, they use facial recognition for purposes of security and catching suspects in shoplifting crimes. An increasing number of retailers are now using facial recognition technology to **catch shoplifters** to stop the massive revenue loss they face each year as a result of uncaught theft. Some companies use software that allows them to **download faces of customers** that have previously shoplifted so they can spy on them as they return. The algorithm behind “FaceFirst” technology has become so advanced that it can detect faces even with disguises/distractions. Facial recognition is not just used for security purposes and also encompasses things like capturing **demographics data on crowds**. This is a game changing strategy for the marketing side of a company so that they can see who is purchasing their goods and cater to the according crowds of people. 


## Phone Companies

As mentioned previously, this is a relatively new feature that came out for apple phones in 2017. Not only is facial recognition used for security of the phone it is also used by many **applications** on the phone. The App Store on Apple phones also **verifies purchases** of apps through verification of facial recognition while it used to be through typing in a matching apple ID password corresponding to the device. Unlocking the phone itself used to be the biometric authentication of **fingerprint detection**, but the accuracy was much less than that of facial recognition. There has been great debate whether face ID or touch ID is superior. As formerly mentioned, Face ID in the iPhone X uses TrueDepth camera and Dot projector that puts over 30,000 dots on the face to be detected. Infrared technology acknowledges the placement of each dot and the results are checked against a database. Touch ID has been used in apple products since 2013 using a finger print map that is stored on your device (not on apple’s servers). Overall, both methods of biometric authentication can be overridden with a password on the phone. With that being said, if your password is easy to guess like “0000” or “1234”, it does not matter whether you use facial recognition or fingerprint recognition; your phone’s security is **arbitrary and can likely be easily hacked**.
